# Global-Terrorism-Dashboard
Terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political, ideological, or religious goals. It is a tactic used by individuals or groups to achieve their objectives by creating fear and causing disruption.

Terrorism can take many forms, including bombings, assassinations, hijackings, and cyberattacks. It can be carried out by state actors or by non-state actors, such as terrorist organizations or extremist groups. The impact of terrorism is far-reaching, as it can cause physical harm, psychological trauma, and economic damage.

However, the problem of terrorism remains a significant global challenge, and efforts to address it must be ongoing and multifaceted.
